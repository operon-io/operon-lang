0.9.5-RELEASE :: NOTES
======================

FEATURE
=======
Added function string:isNumeric().
Example:
	Select: "123" => isNumeric()
	#> true

IMPROVEMENT
===========
Number-casting added options (Object). The old parameter $precision was renamed to $options.
  - decimalSeparator <String>
  - groupSeparator <String>
  - precision <Number>
When the $options is given with numeric-value, then it is interpreted as precision (as previously).
Options decimalSeparator and groupSeparator are valid only when the input-value is String.
Example:
	Select: "1 000 000,00" => number({precision: 2, decimalSeparator: ",", groupSeparator: " "})
	#> 1000000.00

IMPROVEMENT
===========
On string-templating, the "Foo %s:foo;" % {foo: "bar"}
uses Path instead of access by key. If value is not found,
then empty-value is used.

IMPROVEMENT
===========
On string-templating, the "Foo %s:key:expr;" % {key: "value"}
Evaluates the expr against the value behind the key.

IMPROVEMENT
===========
String-templating can be used against Raw-values.

FIX
===
Checks if string-template is not terminated.

FIX
===
PathValue.get returns EmptyType if the key is not found.
Previously threw an error.
