in($array)

Checks if the given current-value is found from the given array.

Note that the current-value may also be a Function-reference with one parameter 
or LambdaFunction-reference with one parameter. In this case the produced output
is checked against the currently iterated array-value.

    Select: 10 => in([10, 20, 30])
    #> true
