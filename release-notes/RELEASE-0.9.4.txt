0.9.4-RELEASE :: NOTES
======================

FIX
===
String-templating use dot always as decimal-separator.
Example:
	* Select: \"PI=%.2f\" % 3.141592
	  #> "PI=3.141592"

FIX
===
Multiline padded strings with """> now align the new lines better.

IMPROVEMENT
===========
Logical-operators and multiple nodes: improved error message (e.g. when types do not match):
  - added the sourceCodeLineNumber, and lhs and rhs -values into the message for binary-operators.
  - added the sourceCodeLineNumber for multiple nodes, making it easier to locate the error quickly.

FEATURE
=======
Added function: array:contains($test) <Boolean>.
This behaves the same as array:forAtLeast(1, $test).
